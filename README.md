# ⚙️ FixQuest — Workflow Repair System
### *A pixel-inspired repair tracking solution*

</div>

> **Status:** ✅ Functional Prototype / Internship Side Project

---

## 🧩 Overview

**FixQuest** is a **personal side project** developed during my internship period.  
It was **not assigned by the company** — I created it after identifying a **workflow gap** in how repair tasks were tracked, updated, and reported.

The goal was simple:
> **Make repair workflows clearer, lighter, and easier to follow.**

FixQuest focuses on **clarity over complexity**, using a pixel-inspired UI to make task progress easy to understand at a glance.

---

## 🔧 Core Purpose

FixQuest was built to solve one main problem:

- Repair jobs were hard to track  
- Progress updates were unclear  
- Task ownership wasn’t visually obvious  

FixQuest introduces a **structured yet lightweight system** that improves visibility without overengineering the workflow.
